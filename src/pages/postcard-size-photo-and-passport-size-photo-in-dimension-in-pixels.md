### **\_**Passport photo in pixels**\_**

600x600 pixels


According to the U.S. State Department guidelines for passports, the digital images must be in a square aspect or 1:1 ratio. The minimum and maximum number of pixels should be 600 x 600 and 1200 x 1200, respectively. The photo needs to have high resolution, with no grainy or blurry parts.

Your passport photo should be in color (24 bits per pixel) in sRGB color space and must be saved in JPEG format. Since the file size must not be over 240 kB, you should compress the image to fit the maximum file size. Keep in mind that the compression ratio should not exceed 20:1, or photo quality gets affected.


## Are Passport and Visa Photos the Same Size?

The passport requirements are set by the issuing country, but the visa requirements are set by the country you intend to visit. Every country has different rules. While some accept digital photos, others may want physical copies similar to passport photos.

## How To Take a High-Quality Passport Photo

1. Upload an image to any photo editing software

2. Resize and rotate it as required

3. Crop it to a square image of at least 600 x 600 pixels

4. Save the photo to your computer

5. Print it to attach to your passport application

## What aspect ratio is a passport photo?

Your passport photograph must measure exactly 2 by 2 inches (51 by 51 millimeters). The State Department does not allow for any flexibility in the overall size of the image. If you are submitting the image digitally, use any square aspect ratio to ensure the width and height remain equal.

## Universal photos

The theory of applied photography distinguishes the category of so-called Universal photos, which are suitable for multiple documents due to having the same requirements for e.g. poses, but above all the size of the photo. Because the vast majority of photographers in India sell pictures for documents in sets of 4 or 8 identical shots, it's worth knowing where these can be used, because usually one picture is all you need.

## Available sizes for universal photos

The most common dimensions used for photos are 3.5 x 4.5 cm photos and 2 x 2 in photos in the USA. Those photographs are usually suitable for such documents as ID cards, passports, driving licenses, student IDs, transport cards etc...

## Digital Image Requirements

### The digital image must adhere to the following specifications:

- Dimensions :  The image dimensions must be in a square aspect ratio (the height must be equal to the width). Minimum acceptable dimensions are 600 x 600 pixels. Maximum acceptable dimensions are 1200 x 1200 pixels. Please review photo requirements for specific dimensions.
- Color :   The image must be in color (24 bits per pixel) in sRGB color space which is the common output for most digital cameras.
- File Format :  The image must be in JPEG file format
- File Size :   The image must be less than or equal to 240 kB (kilobytes).
- Compression :  The image may need to be compressed in order for it to be under the maximum file size. The compression ratio should be less than or equal to 20:1.
